# Villa Gading

Public villa website and booking flow for Villa Gading. The frontend is a static Vite/React site. Bookings, availability, admin access, payments, and confirmation email are handled by Supabase.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 24 and a Supabase project for development.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Create `.env.local` locally. Never commit it.

```dotenv
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_ANON_OR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
```

Only public browser keys may use the `VITE_` prefix. Service-role, payment, email, Turnstile secret, and calendar-feed credentials belong in Supabase Edge Function secrets.

## Production secrets

Set these in **Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets** or with `supabase secrets set`:

- `MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY`
- `MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION`
- `BOOKING_ICAL_VILLA_1`
- `BOOKING_ICAL_VILLA_2`
- `BOOKING_ICAL_EXPORT_TOKEN`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`

Use a separate, randomly generated value of at least 32 bytes for `BOOKING_ICAL_EXPORT_TOKEN`. Do not paste any secret or private calendar URL into issues, documentation, source code, or chat.

Supabase automatically provides its server-side project URL and secret/service-role credentials to Edge Functions. Never copy those credentials into the frontend.

## Coordinated production rollout

The payment capability migration, `booking-create`, `midtrans-create-transaction`, and the public frontend are version-coupled. Do not deploy them independently.

Prepare and build the matching public frontend first. Then use a maintenance window with public booking temporarily unavailable: resolve every legacy `pending_payment` booking that lacks a capability hash, apply the migration, deploy all functions, immediately deploy the prepared frontend, run the security smoke tests, and only then reopen booking. The migration intentionally stops rather than silently modifying a possibly real reservation.

With public booking already in maintenance mode, link and verify the intended Supabase project, then deploy the database and functions:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy booking-calendar
supabase functions deploy booking-create
supabase functions deploy booking-ical-export
supabase functions deploy midtrans-create-transaction
supabase functions deploy midtrans-webhook
```

Immediately deploy the matching public frontend with its public Turnstile site key configured. Until it is live and verified, keep booking in maintenance mode because the fail-closed function correctly rejects old clients.

The private website-to-Booking.com availability feed has this shape:

```text
https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.functions.supabase.co/booking-ical-export?villa=1&token=YOUR_PRIVATE_EXPORT_TOKEN
```

Use the matching `villa=2` URL for the second villa. Treat the complete URL as a credential because it contains the feed token.

## Admin access

The admin interface uses Supabase email/password authentication. Database RLS separately requires the signed-in user to exist in `public.admin_users`; hiding the route is not treated as security.

Create the user in Supabase Authentication, then add that exact user ID to `public.admin_users` through the SQL editor. Public sign-up should remain disabled.

## Deployment

The public site deploys through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to GitHub Pages. Configure only public build values there. Keep all server secrets in Supabase.

After deployment, verify:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Then test one real booking in sandbox mode, confirm the Turnstile challenge is enforced, verify that the private iCalendar feed rejects a missing or incorrect token, and confirm that a signed-out browser cannot read booking rows.

## Security notes

- Guest price is recalculated inside `booking-create`; the browser total is not trusted.
- A private payment capability is required in addition to the booking reference.
- Midtrans is the source of truth for paid status. Client redirects do not confirm payment.
- The database exclusion constraint prevents overlapping non-cancelled bookings under concurrent requests.
- Turnstile fails closed if its server secret is missing.
- Exported calendars contain blocked dates only—never guest names, contact details, or booking references.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and credential-rotation guidance.

## Required credential rotation

Older revisions of this repository exposed two Booking.com native calendar-feed URLs. Removing them from the current README does not invalidate them. Regenerate both export links in Booking.com, update `BOOKING_ICAL_VILLA_1` and `BOOKING_ICAL_VILLA_2` in Supabase, and stop using the old links.
